🎸 Chord Classification
🚀 Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based chord classification system that identifies musical chords from audio recordings. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Chroma feature extraction, the model can accurately recognize chords from WAV files.

✨ Features
Supports a wide range of chords: major, minor, diminished, augmented, 7th, and more.
Advanced audio processing: Uses Chroma feature extraction for precise chord identification.
Deep learning-powered: Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and Librosa.
User-friendly interface: Interactive UI with Streamlit for real-time predictions.
Customizable and extensible: Train the model with additional chord samples for improved accuracy.
